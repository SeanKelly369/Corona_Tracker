# Corona_Tracker
Starting with Ireland and hopefully, later the rest of the world, the aim is to create an application that can help track and record locations where the Corona virus exists and areas that can be deemed clear so we get back out of hibernation safely and as soon as possible, with hopefully some lives saved along the way.
